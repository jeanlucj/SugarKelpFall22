# Analysis

Things I have to do
1. What GP and SP names do I have with the marker matrices?
2. Damn: should I even trust the marker matrices, given that they were made by
BreedBase, which doesn't know about diploid versus haploid
3. What GP and SP names do I have with the phenotypes?
4. What phenotypes do I want to worry about?
5. Pull in the CovComb from Akdemir
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CovCombR/index.html
6. Get the pedigrees, either from BreedBase or by deduction
7. Make the pedigree-based relationship matrix
